# Breast-Cancer-Detection-from-Histopathology-Images-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
Implemented and compared ML and DL models for breast cancer detection from histopathology images, combining feature engineering, CNN transfer learning, and statistical validation.

This repository presents a comprehensive Machine Learning and Deep Learning–based approach for breast cancer classification using histopathological images from the BreaKHis dataset.

The project combines classical ML models (XGBoost, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, LDA, SVM) using handcrafted features such as HSV color histograms and Haralick texture features, along with Deep Learning models including CNN and transfer learning architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet, Inception).

Models are evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and standard performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score). Statistical rigor is ensured through One-Way ANOVA and Bonferroni-corrected pairwise t-tests, highlighting the performance gap between traditional ML and modern DL approaches.
